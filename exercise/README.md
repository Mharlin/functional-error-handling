1. Change method signatures so that the intent of the function is clear.  
  There should be no need to look at the implementation when you want to use the function.  
  Return a clear error message to the user.
  For the moment, leave the execution of the Future in the functions.  
  
2. Move the effect execution to the outer edge.
  Suggest looking at the cats EitherT documentation for inspiration.
